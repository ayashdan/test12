Tenerife (/tɛnəˈriːf/; Spanish: [teneˈɾife]) is the largest and most populated island of the seven Canary Islands.[2] It is also the most populated island of Spain,[2] with a land area of 2,034.38 square kilometres (785 sq mi) and 898,680 inhabitants,[3] 43 percent of the total population of the Canary Islands.[2] Tenerife is the largest and most populous island of Macaronesia.[4]

About five million tourists visit Tenerife each year, the most of any of the Canary Islands.[5] It is one of the most important tourist destinations in Spain[6] and the world.[6] Tenerife hosts one of the world's largest carnivals and the Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife is working to be designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[7]

Served by two airports, Tenerife North Airport and Tenerife South Airport, Tenerife is the economic centre of the archipelago.[8][9] The 1977 collision of two Boeing 747 passenger jets at Tenerife North Airport, resulting in 583 deaths, remains the deadliest aviation accident in world history.

Santa Cruz de Tenerife is the capital of the island and the seat of the island council (cabildo insular). The city is capital of the autonomous community of Canary Islands (shared with Las Palmas), sharing governmental institutions such as presidency and ministries. Between the 1833 territorial division of Spain and 1927, Santa Cruz de Tenerife was the sole capital of the Canary Islands. In 1927 the Crown ordered that the capital of the Canary Islands be shared, as it remains at present.[10][11] Santa Cruz contains the modern Auditorio de Tenerife, the architectural symbol of the Canary Islands.[12][13]

The island is home to the University of La Laguna; founded in 1792 in San Cristóbal de La Laguna, it is the oldest university in the Canaries. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the city is the second to have been founded on the island, and is the third of the archipelago. The city of La Laguna was capital of the Canary Islands before Santa Cruz replaced it in 1833.[14]

Teide National Park, a World Heritage Site in the center of the island, has Teide, the highest elevation of Spain, the highest of the islands of the Atlantic Ocean, and the third-largest volcano in the world from its base.[15] Also located on the island, Macizo de Anaga since 2015 has been designated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.[16] It has the largest number of endemic species in Europe.[16]
